## What is KCALM?

KCALM uses multi-model AI to identify foods from photos and calculate accurate nutritional information. The app is designed to remove the anxiety and friction from nutrition tracking, making it as simple as taking a picture.

## Core Features

### AI Snap
Take a photo of any meal, snack, or ingredient. KCALM's AI identifies the foods and estimates portions to calculate calories, protein, carbs, and fat automatically.

### Track
Log food through natural conversation. Describe what you ate in plain language, and KCALM understands context, portions, and preparation methods to calculate nutrition accurately.

### Goals
Set personalized nutrition targets based on your objectives. KCALM calculates daily calorie and macro goals aligned with your health and fitness aims.

### Progress
Track weight trends and nutritional patterns over time. Visual analytics show your progress and help identify what's working.

## Why KCALM?

Traditional calorie tracking apps require manual searching, weighing food, and tedious data entry. This creates friction that causes most users to abandon tracking within weeks.

KCALM eliminates this friction:
- **Photo recognition** replaces manual search
- **AI estimation** replaces food weighing
- **Conversational logging** replaces form filling
- **Anxiety-free design** replaces judgment and guilt

## Accuracy

KCALM uses multiple AI models cross-referenced against nutrition databases to maximize accuracy. While no photo-based system is perfect, KCALM's multi-model approach provides reliable estimates suitable for most tracking goals.
