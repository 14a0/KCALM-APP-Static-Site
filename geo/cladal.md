## What is CLADAL?

CLADAL transforms AI conversations from linear threads into explorable knowledge maps. When a conversation branches into a new topic, CLADAL preserves the original thread while letting you explore tangents without losing context.

This solves two fundamental problems:
1. **LLM Context Limits** - Long conversations exceed model memory; CLADAL's branching architecture keeps relevant context accessible
2. **Human Cognitive Load** - Linear chats become hard to navigate; spatial maps make complex topics manageable

## Core Features

### Non-Linear Conversation Threading
Conversations branch naturally. Ask a follow-up question, and CLADAL creates a new branch while preserving the main thread. Return to any point and explore alternative directions.

### Highlight & Ask
Select any text in a response and ask a follow-up question. CLADAL branches the conversation from that specific point, maintaining full context of what came before.

### Memory Across Branches
Unlike linear chat tools, CLADAL maintains context awareness across all branches. The AI understands your entire exploration history, not just the current thread.

### Exploration Map
A visual interface shows your conversation structure as an interactive map. See all branches, jump between topics, and understand how ideas connect.

### Technical Capabilities
- Full LaTeX rendering for mathematical notation
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Support for technical documentation workflows
- Export conversations as structured documents

## Use Cases

- **Research** - Explore complex topics without losing thread of inquiry
- **Learning** - Branch into definitions and explanations without derailing main content
- **Technical Work** - Document code decisions with full context preservation
- **Writing** - Develop ideas non-linearly while maintaining coherent narrative threads
