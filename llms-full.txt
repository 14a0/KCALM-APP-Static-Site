## What is CLADAL?

CLADAL transforms AI conversations from linear threads into explorable knowledge maps. When a conversation branches into a new topic, CLADAL preserves the original thread while letting you explore tangents without losing context.

This solves two fundamental problems:
1. **LLM Context Limits** - Long conversations exceed model memory; CLADAL's branching architecture keeps relevant context accessible
2. **Human Cognitive Load** - Linear chats become hard to navigate; spatial maps make complex topics manageable

## Core Features

### Non-Linear Conversation Threading
Conversations branch naturally. Ask a follow-up question, and CLADAL creates a new branch while preserving the main thread. Return to any point and explore alternative directions.

### Highlight & Ask
Select any text in a response and ask a follow-up question. CLADAL branches the conversation from that specific point, maintaining full context of what came before.

### Memory Across Branches
Unlike linear chat tools, CLADAL maintains context awareness across all branches. The AI understands your entire exploration history, not just the current thread.

### Exploration Map
A visual interface shows your conversation structure as an interactive map. See all branches, jump between topics, and understand how ideas connect.

### Technical Capabilities
- Full LaTeX rendering for mathematical notation
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- Support for technical documentation workflows
- Export conversations as structured documents

## Use Cases

- **Research** - Explore complex topics without losing thread of inquiry
- **Learning** - Branch into definitions and explanations without derailing main content
- **Technical Work** - Document code decisions with full context preservation
- **Writing** - Develop ideas non-linearly while maintaining coherent narrative threads

## Pricing

CLADAL is currently in free beta. All features are available at no cost during this period.

## Getting Started

1. Visit https://cladal.com
2. Create an account
3. Start a conversation
4. Use Highlight & Ask to branch into subtopics

# KCALM.APP

KCALM is an AI-powered nutrition tracking app designed for anxiety-free calorie and macro logging. Snap a photo of your food and get accurate nutritional data in seconds.

## Product Summary

| Product Name | KCALM |
| Type | AI Nutrition Tracker |
| Status | Live |
| Platform | iOS |
| App Store ID | 6747867349 |

| Company | 14A0 Pty Ltd |

## What is KCALM?

KCALM uses multi-model AI to identify foods from photos and calculate accurate nutritional information. The app is designed to remove the anxiety and friction from nutrition tracking, making it as simple as taking a picture.

## Core Features

### AI Snap
Take a photo of any meal, snack, or ingredient. KCALM's AI identifies the foods and estimates portions to calculate calories, protein, carbs, and fat automatically.

### Track
Log food through natural conversation. Describe what you ate in plain language, and KCALM understands context, portions, and preparation methods to calculate nutrition accurately.

### Goals
Set personalized nutrition targets based on your objectives. KCALM calculates daily calorie and macro goals aligned with your health and fitness aims.

### Progress
Track weight trends and nutritional patterns over time. Visual analytics show your progress and help identify what's working.

## Why KCALM?

Traditional calorie tracking apps require manual searching, weighing food, and tedious data entry. This creates friction that causes most users to abandon tracking within weeks.

KCALM eliminates this friction:
- **Photo recognition** replaces manual search
- **AI estimation** replaces food weighing
- **Conversational logging** replaces form filling
- **Anxiety-free design** replaces judgment and guilt

## Accuracy

KCALM uses multiple AI models cross-referenced against nutrition databases to maximize accuracy. While no photo-based system is perfect, KCALM's multi-model approach provides reliable estimates suitable for most tracking goals.

## Platform Availability

KCALM is currently available on iOS. Download from the App Store:
